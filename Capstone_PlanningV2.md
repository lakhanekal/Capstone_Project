# Potential
- We can do regression and time series both
- If required we can reach out to IMHO to discuss the possibility to include our analysis if the findings are significant
- Combine with other macro factors to find potential latent variables and possible lags
- Comparative approach to study the difference between the characteristic of whole population and the suicidal group
- There is no webpage showing trends, interactive plots in Indian context
